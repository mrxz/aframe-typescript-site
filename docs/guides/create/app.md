# Creating an App
Creating an app can easily be done using the A-Frame Typescript generators.

## 1. Install `yeoman` and the `generator-aframe-typescript`
A-Frame Typescript uses [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io) for scaffolding new projects. The generator is available from NPM and can be installed using the following command.
```bash
npm install -g yeoman generator-aframe-typescript
```

## 2. Run the generator
Once installed you can run the generator to start the scaffolding
```bash
yo aframe-typescript
```
You will be asked some questions like the apps name.

## 3. Running the app
Once generated, you're all ready to go. Open up the folder in VS Code and use `yarn dev` to take your newly created A-Frame + TypeScript app for a spin.
