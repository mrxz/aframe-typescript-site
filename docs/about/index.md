# About
This project aims to make working with A-Frame and TypeScript a pleasant experience. The main goals of the project are:

 * **Typing with minimal helpers**: Getting all of the benefits of TypeScript while still writing idiomatic A-Frame code (just like you're used to)
 * **Interoperability**: Easily use many of the pre-existing A-Frame components out there, or publish your own A-Frame components for anyone to use (even if they don't use TypeScript!)
 * **Documentation**: Provide quick access to documentation of core and community components, systems and primitives as well as easily creating documentation for your own components.
 * **Opinionated Tooling**: Enhance the developer experience by providing a combination of tools that "just work". Easily scaffold new projects all setup to easily develop and publish them.
